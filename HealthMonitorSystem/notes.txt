libraries (picture)
explaination of what the libraries are for ?

software 
snip of the src file
main.c file 
explain the function and how they working
(explain the code)
using small snips


issues faced:
vivado and vitis versions . when build the platform in vitis some stuff are missing in the parameter file.
if u use example code, a lot of erros will happen. in older version 2022.1 no issue were face except for make file

make file issue
https://adaptivesupport.amd.com/s/article/75527?language=en_US
i went to each pmod we used and searched for the makefile for it and updated it and regenrated the bitstream and built
the platform


memory issue
https://adaptivesupport.amd.com/s/question/0D52E00006hpURGSA2/bram-size-limitation-to-be-used-as-the-microblaze95rev30-instruction-memory-viv20154-ac701v10?language=en_US
i added new Bram controlles exactly similar to the ones genrated automatically by vivado block design
I connected them and adjust some of the blocks related and make the connection.
i went to the address editor and did right click then assign because those new blocks were not assigned.
I manipulated the addressing of them in order to have the end of the old memory, connected to the start of the new
added memory. 

i reorginzed the other addresses for the stuff. i increased the size to 128k . 
basically added new memory in concat and fixed any addressing issues that appears when selecting the 128k

generated bit stream . updated the new wrapper file xsa in vivits and made a new project and copied the files from old
application projet. i opened the lscript.ld file and assinged new memory range size for it with this line of code

microblaze_0_local_memory_ilmb_bram_if_cntlr_Mem_microblaze_0_local_memory_dlmb_bram_if_cntlr_Mem : ORIGIN = 0x50, LENGTH = 0x3FB80
old one was :
   microblaze_0_local_memory_ilmb_bram_if_cntlr_Mem_microblaze_0_local_memory_dlmb_bram_if_cntlr_Mem : ORIGIN = 0x50, LENGTH = 0x1FFB0


output:
the temperture value if it is normal it will pritned normally in the serial monitor slowly. ever 1.5seconds
if temp get to some dangerous value, warnings will be sent to the BLE and also printed on serial monitar with colors and 
with alot of speed.
if fall is detected (force >4) , warning will be sent through the BLE and warning will be printed through the serial with 
colors. the force value will be sent and the x y z then it will move to waiting
in the ble it will wait for 5 seconds then check again if the person fell or not. it will send the x y z values too to
allow user to check manuallay the numbers
patien
if kashif data are requested, using the ble , temp and status will be sent with the acl values x y z
if the name doest match, ble will send that the name was not found (feedback message)

when ble is connected, ble device will get the message that they are connected . the serial terminal will print that
the ble device is connected
if the ble device is disconnected the serial monitor will display that it got disconnected

basically, the ble and serial monitor will dsiaply the nesscary data and are used to give feedbacks to the user
warnings,data , system status...
