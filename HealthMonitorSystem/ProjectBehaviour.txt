Behaviour:

Accelo: If magnitude gets above some value (falling value), we send a warning message through BLE to phone
	and send next values of x y z (three values to see if the person is moving or not)
	we check after some time (5 seconds) if the value indicating that the person is moving , then
	the fall detection was wrong. If the values indicating no movement, it means the perosn is not moving
	and on ground. (BLE CAN also be used for communction between the sick person and the nurse or idk)
	
	Three conditions to give the person status:
	if z value is 1.3 and other values close to 0, the person is standing maybe
	if z value is 1.3 and other values (x or y) are above 0.3 it means this person is moving in some 
	direction
	if the z value is close to 0 and one of the other values (x or y) is clos to 1.3 , it means this person
	is sleeping or (fell)
	

Temprature: First: If temp exceeds some value (25c ) a warning will be sent to the nurse through BLE with the
	    actual temp value.
	    Second: The nurse can send name of sick person through BLE and the temp value of that person will
		    Will be sent back to her/him.

BLE: 		What was used in the top. we sent the hit value (falling value) to show how hard was the fall
		in case of a warning. the status of the person (sitting, standing, walking) can be checked
		if asked for by nurse
		

SerialMonitor: We print the temp value in nice way so someone can come and look at it like a screen displaying
		data of sick person. slow the printing down a bit. also the warning stuff with the value
		

note: The board need to be in flat table because it first calibrates the acl . if it was tilted or idk, the readings will be
	not valid
